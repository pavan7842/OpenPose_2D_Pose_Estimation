# OpenPose: 2D Pose Estimation
🚀 **Real-Time Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation Using OpenPose**  

This project implements **OpenPose** using deep learning for **real-time multi-person 2D pose estimation** with Part Affinity Fields (PAFs). It detects and tracks body key points from images and videos.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Developed a **multi-person pose estimation** model using OpenPose and CMU’s Caffe-based framework.
- Implemented and tested in **Google Colab** for cloud-based execution.
- Applied **Part Affinity Fields (PAFs)** for pose tracking across frames.
- Evaluated results using **custom datasets** and **pre-trained models**.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `code/` → Python scripts used for running OpenPose in Colab.
- `datasets/` → Sample dataset used for training/testing.
- `results/` → Output images/videos from the model.
